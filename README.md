# BDS-2023
The projects I have done during Biological Data Science School 2023 in Uzhhorod

## Blood_cells (Final project)

In blood-cells.ipynb I am training the model to classify the Blood cells dataset from Kaggle.

I used ResNet50V2 for the task and got 99.6% validation accuracy. 

## Cancer Task

The purpose of this task was to make an inference about the relation between different types of cancer using the provided datasets.
The datasets have a lot of irrelevant and missing data, which was the main difficulty of the task.

Exploring the data I decided to use only transcriptions-level data.
I have done PCA (dim=3), and do a 3D plot to see the distribution of different types of cancer in space.
